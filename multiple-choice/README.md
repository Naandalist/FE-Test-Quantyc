## Explanation of the answers for each question above

1. required HTML
    
    < html >, < head >, < title >, and < body > are the required HTML tags for a standard HTML document.

2.  `_blank` is used to open a web page in a new window.
   
3. Explanation:
   
   An example of a property that can be inherited is the `font-size` property. If a parent element has a font-size of 16px, and a child element within it does not have a specific font-size defined, the child element will inherit the font-size of 16px from its parent. 
   
   This means that the text within the child element will also be displayed at a font-size of 16px. Another example is `text-shadow` property, it allows to set a shadow effect to the text. If a parent element has a text-shadow and a child element within it does not have a specific text-shadow defined, the child element will inherit the text-shadow from its parent.
   
   In contrast, properties like "flex" and "transition" are not inherited. They need to be set explicitly on an element for them to take effect.


4. `Null == undefined` is true.
   
   `NaN == NaN` is false, because NaN is a special value that represents "Not a Number" and it is not equal to any other value, including itself.
   
   `0 === '0'` is false, because the triple equals operator (===) compares both the value and the type of the operands, and 0 is a number while '0' is a string.
   
   `False == '0'` is false, because False is a boolean value, while '0' is a string.
